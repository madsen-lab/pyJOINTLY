# JOINTLY : Joint clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets
![Graphical Abstract](figs/graphical_abstract.png)

JOINTLY is an algorithm to jointly cluster single cell RNA sequencing datastes using kernel based joint non-negativ matrix factorizaiton, allowing it to jointly non-linear manifolds. JOINTLY effectively captures shared cell states and while robustly accounting for dataset specific states.
